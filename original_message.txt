in the constellation of cygnus there lurks a mysterious invisible force the black hole of cygnus x one six stars of the northern cross in mourning for their sisters loss in a final flash of glory nevermore to grace the night invisible to telescopic eye infinity the star that would not die all who dare to cross her course are swallowed by a fearsome force through the void to be destroyed or is there something more atomized at the core or through the astral door to soar i set a course just east of lyra and northwest of pegasus flew into the light of deneb sailed across the milky way on my ship the rocinante wheeling through the galaxies headed for the heart of cygnus headlong into mystery the x ray is her siren song my ship cannot resist her long nearer to my deadly goal until the black hole gains control spinning whirling still descending like a spiral sea unending sound and fury drowns my heart every nerve is torn apart
